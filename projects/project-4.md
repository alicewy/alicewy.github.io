 -Fridgee is a food recommendation application that was created for the 2017 NASA Space Apps Challenge under the category "What's for Dinner?"
 -The app takes in user input of the contents in a fridge in order to recommend recipes for foodstuffs closing to their expiration date, to tackle the issue of excess waste.
 -The application recommends recipes if there is at least a 70% match of ingredients, and also offers a list of food preservation tips.
