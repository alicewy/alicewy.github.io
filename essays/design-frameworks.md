This essay is written to address the 
<a href = "http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f17/morea/design-patterns/experience-design-patterns-technical-essay.html"> module on Design Patterns</a>, which include addressing what a design pattern is, and how it has been used in our code experiences.

## The cookie-cutter problems

Picture this - Christmas is coming up, and to celebrate the theme, you want to make snowmen and snowflake shaped cookies. You'll have the option of hand-cutting the cookies yourself, or using some cookie cutters you already have.

Of course, if you were me, hand cutting would result in the snowmen cookies looking like this:

and the snowflake....

unless I spend a large amount of time and effort, I probably wouldn't be able to even closely replicate the nice snowmen and snowflake cookies in the first image, and hand-cutting those cookies would expend a considerable more amount of time, and effort. But, having the cookie-cutters for the snowmen and snowflake would mean I would have a lot more freedom designing with the color, or other aspects of it, to personalize a cookie that already has a relatively nice foundation.

The same concept comes into play in regards to <a href = "https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns">design patterns</a> - "a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.", and why people would desire to use them. 

Design patterns are categorized as either: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral by <a href = "https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns">sourcemaking</a>, and have stimulated criticisms due to inefficient solutions, wrong problems targetted, and lack in formal foundations.

## Programming with patterns...as their design basis

Before I had even been aware of the concept of something such as Design Patterns, I was programming in C++ with the thought that its syntax was quite similar to Java, which made sense, since Java was actually modeled after the C and C++ language(s). And unbeknownst to me at that time, using something simple such as private static variable, private constructors, and public static methods were known as singleton design methods under the category of creational design patterns.
