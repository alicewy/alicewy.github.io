## So... Why am I in ICS in the first place?

This is a Technical Essay written for the purpose of understanding myself, and why I decided to take ICS 314: Software Engineering. 
To begin with, I have never had any doubt that ICS was the right major for me. I decided it on the spur of a moment, I was actually stuck
between five choices to major in - Biology, Economics, English, Political Science, and Psychology. Neither of which really had anything to
do with Computer Science on the surface. Neither of those majors really made me feel excited about them, either. 

I knew what all of them
entailed, and I couldn't imagine my life going in either direction. And then, perchance, it somehow happened that I found out that Computer 
Science was a major. Without even a second thought about the rest, I immediately decided to declare a Computer Science major, even if I
really didn't know anything about programming, but I couldn't help but think: "this is very, very, very much cooler." Now perhaps, because
of the irrational passion I have for the major, even if I experience difficulties, and I often do, I have never thought of doing anything
else.

## Software Engineering and its usefulness

A primary reason as to why I go through ICS, and why I'm taking 314, is that I hope to keep changing for the better. 
To advance myself further and improve my skillset and obtain knowledge in using different development tools.
I've heard good things about this class, so I hope and expect that this course will prepare me further in developing myself professionally.  

## So, my Goals for ICS 314: Software Engineering

- Hackathon Preparedness
- Mastery ++++ ( A ++++ )
- Improvement in knowledge and towards becoming a ***Full Stack Developer***
- Proficiency in logic and programming in person
- Professional Development
