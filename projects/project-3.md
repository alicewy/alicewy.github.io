During the summer of 2017 I took it upon myself to familiarize myself with various game making tools. After doing some research I decided to try out Unreal Engine 4 due to it being user friendly, beginner friendly, and free. For materials such as images I used GIMP 2.0 to create art which were all in pixel art style.

Instead of typing out lines of code, I utilized Unreal Engine's blueprint system to create a 2D side scrolling game. Blueprints allowed me to make core game functions quickly. Which consisted of running and jumping and giving obstacles within the game movements and other instructions. 

Although GIMP may not be as intricate as photoshop the tools required to create pixel art was present on GIMP. I created several sprite sheets to add into Unreal Engine and animated them using a flipbook.

This project was important to me because it allowed me to broaden my skills and familiarize myself with an enviroment suited to creating a game.
