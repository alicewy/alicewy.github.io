This essay is targeted towards addressing the questions on issues students of ICS 314 have faced during their first time using meteor, <a href= "http://goo.gl/CdWGyh">click here</a> for more information.

## Startup times and issues I experienced...

The intial startup time for meteor during an instance when I forked a repository to use to become more comfortable with using meteor, I had envoked a command such as **meteor --no-release-check --settings ../config/settings.development.json** , which took an extremely long time to finish running, approximately 40 minutes on a sleep deprived night. I found myself waking up the next day's morning with my laptop battery nearly drained.

**Now, the issues at hand, with a little background ... **

The programming languages I have learned so far before taking ICS 314 were mostly functional programming languages, as opposed to markup languages. Although I knew html, I did not take a class learning html in-depth. So, using a tool such as meteor was a whole new experience for me, unknowing what to expect.

**The first issue I came across...**

The first issue I came across was during an in-class WOD for ICS 314, and during that in class WOD, I found out that I could call the functions from a different class by specifying the function name inside of curly braces. 

**The second issue **

The second issue I came across, was understanding how different uses of the directories provided such as the client directories, the index.html file, etc. had to link together, how not linking them together with provided files caused issues with the project setup.
