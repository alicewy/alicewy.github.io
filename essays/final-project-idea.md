Have you ever been hungry, but only have around 30 minutes to spare between classes? What if there was a way to get your food fast and without
having to walk a large distance from your class? What if you're missing some key supplies for class, but your schedule is just too booked?
We thought of a solution, and it is: Deliver (You)HM

Deliver (You)HM will cater to your needs, wherever you are on campus. Quick delivery from on-campus food vendors to bookstore supplies
and payments can even be made through your UH Manoa account, using Campus Cash!

## Mockup page Ideas

- Drop down table of stores the different vendors on campus
- One checkout cart for the entire site
- Can make multiple purchases 
- Home page (Big letters saying Deliver (You)HM with background pic
- Specials/Deals Tab
- Search bar/filter 
- Clicking on stores tab goes to filter page
- User login on the right most side
- Events tab (related to UHM students)

## Use Case 

- Short time frame between classes and need food/supplies
- Feeling Lazy?
- Physically impaired?
- No Worries!

## Beyond the basics
- Shortest path algorithm for vendors to deliver
- Simple update and removal for Events tab and Daily special and deals tab
- Checkout removing and adding items to the cart
- User Settings (Notifications or not, pay using .... Campus Cash or Visa/ etc subway giftcards...)
