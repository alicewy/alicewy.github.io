## Startup times and issues I experienced...

The intial startup time for meteor during an instance when I forked a repository to use to become more comfortable with using meteor, I had envoked a command such as **meteor --no-release-check --settings ../config/settings.development.json** , which took an extremely long time to finish running, approximately 40 minutes on a sleep deprived night. I found myself waking up the next day's morning with my laptop battery nearly drained.
