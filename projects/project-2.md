This project was my attempt to recreate the renown mobile app flappy bird. The purpose of this project was to create something not connected to school so that I can put the knowledge I've learned in class in practice. So instead of using Eclipse I used Android Studio and looked up how to utilize the tools offered in Android Studio.

In my recreation of flappy bird I used a game framework created by BadLogicGames called libGDX. My attempt at recreating flappy bird was similar to the original with the exception of a score keeping system. The game consisted of several modes such as a main menu and game mode.The player would be able to make the bird jump by tapping or clicking on the screen during the game mode.
