Computer Science was a major I picked out of the blue, it was something I had no background experience in before the past year. I would see some of my friends pick up everything at an O(1) pace, while it would take me O(n) to understand even the most basic material. Which, is why I decided to take up a project class in revamping Techfolios. With the knowledge I obtain from the experience, I'd like to become more comfortable with using different frameworks and languages to prepare me for taking ICS 314 in my next semester. 

Now, since the beginning of the Techfolio project, the biggest struggle I had was understanding the technical jargon involved. Even then, googling didn't quite give me the answers I expected. I'd understand what certain things were after reading a definition, but I'd miss a connection to what the purpose was. I was missing the experience.

As a beginner, here are some of the questions I asked myself while updating my Techfolio...

## What was a JSON file? What's it used for?

A simple google search of JSON would give a result such as: "JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML. Squarespace uses JSON to store and organize site content created with the CMS." 

But I found a better answer from googling a bit more: https://www.copterlabs.com/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/ , even then, I didn't know really know how it was incorporated into this project, but replacing information on the given template works because of everything else already implemented.

It didn't take long at all to understand how to create Techfolio from that point on, but without the quickstart video, and only looking at the written guide, it would have taken me much longer to understand how to do so. 

## [USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io] Page build failure -- What did I do now?

When I deleted the last section under "work" from the given template that had two sections, I deleted a "]," while there was a "}," and "]" closing brackets. It didn't take me long to find this error, but my resume also did not update properly because of that error, and I received the nice little email from GitHub with the following message:

```
The page build failed for the `master` branch with the following error:

There was a YAML syntax error on line 88 column 11 in `_data/bio.json`: `did not find expected ',' or ']' while parsing a flow sequence`. For more information, see https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-invalid-yaml-in-data-file/.

## What’s a smart question?

Stack Overflow, a question and answer site for programmers, is a great resource for anyone who may have issues with code or who may simply want to learn new or different methods of doing something. There I found examples of good questions and bad questions, which could probably be improved.

In the following example, we examine the components of a decent question. In this case, the asker is trying to figure out a way to get the date of the previous month in Python.

```
Q: python date of the previous month

I am trying to get the date of the previous month with python. Here is what i've tried:

str( time.strftime('%Y') ) + str( int(time.strftime('%m'))-1 )

However, this way is bad for 2 reasons: First it returns 20122 for the February of 2012 (instead of 201202) 
and secondly it will return 0 instead of 12 on January.

I have solved this trouble in bash with:

echo $(date -d"3 month ago" "+%G%m%d")

I think that if bash has a built-in way for this purpose, then python, much more equipped, should provide something 
better than forcing writing one's own script to achieve this goal. Of course i could do something like:

if int(time.strftime('%m')) == 1:
    return '12'
else:
    if int(time.strftime('%m')) < 10:
        return '0'+str(time.strftime('%m')-1)
    else:
        return str(time.strftime('%m') -1)
        
I have not tested this code and i don't want to use it anyway (unless I can't find any other way:/)

Thanks for your help!
```

While the heading of his question could be better, it does convey what he’s trying to figure out. Usually something as brief as “python date of previous month” is what other users would enter in as search terms on Google, making it easily found. Another good thing about the question is that it’s not just a question. The asker shows what he or she has done and that he or she has put in some effort to answer the question. And while it may not be as important as the question itself, the asker shows courtesy, which does increase the chance of getting an answer.

```
A: datetime and the datetime.timedelta classes are your friend.

1. find today
2. use that to find the first day of this month.
3. use timedelta to backup a single day, to the last day of the previous month.
4. print the YYYYMM string you're looking for.

Like this:

 >>> import datetime
 >>> today = datetime.date.today()
 >>> first = datetime.date(day=1, month=today.month, year=today.year)
 >>> lastMonth = first - datetime.timedelta(days=1)
 >>> print lastMonth.strftime("%Y%m")
 201202
 >>>

```
 
The asker received six possible answers, and he or she was successful in inciting discussion from multiple users. The answers themselves were clear and were devoid of the rumored sarcasm and hostility of “hackers.” Since I myself have referenced this page and found it useful, I can confidently say that it is a good question.

## The foolproof way to get ignored.

While there are decent questions that benefit everyone, there are those one can ask to create an entirely different effect. In the following example, a user asks how he would, in short, create a desktop application with Facebook.

```
Q: Facebook Desktop Notifier

I am a beginner programmer that have never used anything other than what's included in a language.

I am trying to create a desktop application that notifies me anytime I get an update onfacebook. 
How should go about doing this? Thanks in advance.

edit Sorry I was not clear. Is there any way to make a DESKTOP application with facebook?
```

A simple “yes” would have answered the question, but we know that’s not the sort of answer he or she is looking for. Fortunately, someone kindly responded with a link to Facebook’s developer website. The asker should have done more research on his or her potential project. Then further down the road, he or she could have asked more specific and detailed questions that wouldn’t require a thousand-paged response for a sufficient answer.

## Conclusion

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
