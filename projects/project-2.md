Fridgee is a food recommendation application that was created for the 2017 NASA Space Apps Challenge under the category "What's for Dinner?"
The app takes in user input of the contents in a fridge in order to recommend recipes for foodstuffs closing to their expiration date, to tackle the issue of excess waste.
The application recommends recipes if there is at least a 70% match of ingredients, and also offers a list of food preservation tips.

You can learn more about category the app targeted at [NASA SpaceApps](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth-and-us/whats-dinner/details).
