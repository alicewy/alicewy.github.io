This essay is written to address my first experience with using Meteor, and address the <a href = "http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f17/morea/meteor-2/experience-meteor-2-technical-essay.html">questions asked</a> towards my experience:
- What did you find difficult? What did you find easy? What did you find cool and interesting?
- Meteor is an example of a modern, internet-based, client-server application architecture. What are your first impressions of Meteor as an application architecture?

Just like the vocabulary  of mete, my experience as a first time user of Meteor was definitely a new experience, with quite the punishing learning curve. Instances where I made mistakes were everywhere, being unsure of how updating a page would affect the webpage as a whole, for instance, if I created a file, and did not make updated on a file such as the index.js to import that file, it would be unused. Of course, they weren't just small and relatively obvious example such as those, but for directories or different files which require the support of one another, the biggest issue became organizing which with what. 

<b>Was there anything easy?</b> Perhaps, the easiest part was using the command line involved with meteor, which simply involved envoking the few commands, for one particular instance, if meteor was not installed in the directory, envoke meteor npm install. Then, there was meteor npm run start. 

## First Impressions

Meteor seems incredibly useful, especially with its responsive web design and majority of the foundation for projects set up for users to begin. It seems like a great tool for web development, and if I actually knew how to utilize the application more, I would probably be using Meteor for web development side projects.

## Fatal mistakes, and ironically, not from Meteor...

Beginning with Meteor for the first time and working on a project such as <a href = "https://github.com/alicewy/digits">digits</a>, I made such a big mistake that caused the rest of the digit WODs to fail miserably.  As my master branch maintained as the first digit Work Out Of the Day (WOD, the sixth one), I'd create a branch for the second (Sounds OK so far...?) AND THEN (Uh oh) the third, from the same master branch, without creating the branch from the second branch, which would make sense since digits was a week cumulative type of work...

To emphasize how big of an issue that it really was, I would be trying to learn how to complete my third WOD for digits, which included making a working add contacts page, except my third WOD was actually built from my first WOD, meaning I wouldn't have had all the files I'd needed to use to complete my third WOD, which might cause one to even encounter page build errors.
